# Setting up tinyauth with Github Apps

Tinyauth also supports Github Apps for authentication instead of OAuth Apps. Github Apps allow more control over permissions and are a bit more complex to setup. For the time being it is recommended you use the simple [OAuth Apps](/docs/guides/github-oauth.md), but in the future Github may deprecate this method of authentication.

## Requirements

Github requires the following to setup an app:

- Any domain name (even `.local`/`.localhost`)
- A Github account

## Create the Github App

Firstly, open the [Github apps](https://github.com/settings/apps) section and click _New Github App_. You should see the following screen:

![Github New App Screen](/screenshots/github-app-new.png)

There we need to fill in the following information:

**Github App Name** -> The name for your app, it can be anything, e.g. `Tinyauth`

**Homepage URL** -> Again can be anything, you can use `https://tinyauth.app`

**Callback URL** -> This is the important part. You need to put the tinyauth app URL followed by `/api/oauth/callback/github`, e.g. `https://tinyauth.example.com/api/oauth/callback/github`

Under webhook make sure to uncheck the active checkbox as we will not need any webhooks.

Finally under permissions, click account permissions and set the email addresses option to read only.

Then you can create your app and you should be greeted by this screen:

Here, make sure to note down your client ID as we will need it later. We also need a client secret which we can obtain by clicking the _Generate new client secret_ button, you may need to authenticate again but once you do it will appear like this:

![Github Client Secret](/screenshots/github-app-client-secret.png)

Make sure to also note this down as it will not be available again and we will need it for tinyauth.

## Configure Tinyauth

Now that we have our client ID and secret, we can pass it to the tinyauth docker container:

```yaml
tinyauth:
  container_name: tinyauth
  image: ghcr.io/steveiliop56/tinyauth:v3
  restart: unless-stopped
  environment:
    - SECRET=some-random-32-chars-string
    - APP_URL=https://tinyauth.example.com
    - USERS=your-email-password-hash
    - GITHUB_CLIENT_ID=your-github-client-id
    - GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET=your-github-secret
  labels:
    traefik.enable: true
    traefik.http.routers.tinyauth.rule: Host(`tinyauth.example.com`)
    traefik.http.middlewares.tinyauth.forwardauth.address: http://tinyauth:3000/api/auth/traefik
```

::: warning
OAuth doesn't mean security, with the current setup everybody with a Github account can login to Tinyauth as a normal user. If you would like to limit which users can login with OAuth, you can add the `OAUTH_WHITELIST` environment variable and allow only your email address to login. For more information check [here](../reference/configuration.md)
:::

And we are done! After you restart your docker container and go to the tinyauth login screen, you should have an additional option to login with Github.
